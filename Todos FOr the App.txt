Things to fix or implement 

Big functionality:
1.  Add volunteer
2.  edit volunteer
3.  delete volunteer
4.  add/edit/delete/ volunteerRole


Smaller pieces:
1.  role dropdownlists need to have roleid as the value, and role name as the text.  Working with Id's will be easier.
2.  Write AddVolunteer methods.
3.  change ad-hoc queries to StoredProcedures in MySQL
